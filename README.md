COMBO
---------------
An empty starting point for a stateless Ruby API using the rails-api gem, with a React client side app. To fit the definition of stateless, the API does not include action-view, sprockets, or sessions. Roughly speaking, React replaces action-view, Webpack replaces sprockets, and JWT replaces sessions.

run `rails s` on one terminal tab
run `npm run devserve` in concurrent terminal tab

access `localhost:8080` for react clientside app, served by stateless runtime Rails backend API.
